- **Not Solved** Not able to make required fields in form 
- **Not Solved**When getting the data for the ingredients and preparation steps the text was formatted like following:
"['put on the tap,\r\nput the glass under the tap']"
- **Solved** The categories would not display on the index page. Caused by a misunderstanding in the code from my side.
I thought I could just reuse the category code from the categories.html page, but I also had to put the categories variable in the home page
route for the categories to be able to show.
